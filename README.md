## Overview

MDS tracks round and player state to run custom drills and utility commands. Use standard `rc` commands and **modded config variables** to tailor drills to your server's needs.

---

## Quick Start (In‑Game)

1. **Set the arena corners** (use your current position if no coords given):

   ```
   rc set ArenaCorner1
   rc set ArenaCorner2
   ```
2. **Run a drill** (examples):

   ```
   rc 3v3
   rc groupfight
   rc openmelee 2 7
   ```
3. **Spawn bots** (examples):

   ```
   rc bot spawn French ArmyLineInfantry
   rc summonLine 5
   ```

> Commands are **case‑insensitive**. Arguments in `<>` are required; `[ ]` are optional.

---

## Arena

All drills require a rectangular **arena** defined by two corner points *(x,z)*.

* **Config variable:**

  * `mod_variable MDS:SetArena:(x,z),(x,z)`
* **Runtime via `rc`:**

  * `rc set ArenaCorner1 [x,z]` *(uses player pos if none given)*
  * `rc set ArenaCorner2 [x,z]` *(uses player pos if none given)*

---

## Available Commands

All commands must be prefixed with `rc` and require admin.

### `xvx`

**Usage:** `rc xvx <attacking:int> <defending:int> [strategy] [distance:float] [spacing:float] [orientation]`

* Spawns an X‑v‑X match inside the arena using the selected strategy and parameters.
* Shorthand calls are supported using defaults. e.g. `rc 3v2`, `rc 20v1`.
* **Defaults (configurable):** `xvxStrategy`, `xvxDistance`, `xvxSpacing`
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc xvx 3 3 next 4 1 northsouth
  rc 3v3
  ```

### `groupfight`

**Usage:** `rc groupfight [strategy] [distance:float] [spacing:float] [orientation]`

* Spawns both teams in lines for a groupfight inside the arena.
* **Defaults (configurable):** `groupfightStrategy`, `groupfightDistance`, `groupfightSpacing`
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc groupfight random 25 2 180
  rc groupfight
  ```

### `openmelee`

**Usage:** `rc openmelee [spacing:float] [offset:float]`

* Spawns players randomly around the arena to simulate an open melee.
* **Defaults (configurable):** `openMeleeSpacing`, `openMeleeOffset`
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc openmelee 2 7
  rc openmelee
  ```

### `shootingTraining`

**Usage:** `rc shootingTraining`

* Toggle. Turns infinite firearm ammo and firearm trajectory lines on, and off again on the next call.
* Takes no arguments. Replies with the new state.


### `bot`

**Usage:** `rc bot <subcommand> [args]`

* Central command for spawning, summoning, and managing bots.
* Subcommands: `spawn`, `spawnRandom`, `summon`, `summonAt`, `setBotAi`, `setBotDeathPolicy`, `remove`, `list`, `move`, `cfg`
* Dev/probe tools: `probe`, `act`
* See **[Bot Subcommands](#bot-subcommands)** for full details and **[Bot AI Types](#bot-ai-types)** for the available AI behaviours.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot spawn 3 French ArmyLineInfantry
  rc bot remove all
  rc bot list
  ```

### `summonLine`

**Usage:** `rc summonLine [count] [faction] [class] [ai] [death] [name [regtag [uniformId]]]`

* Spawns a shoulder‑to‑shoulder line of bots **centred on your position**, facing your direction.
* `count` overrides `lineBotCount` for this call; faction/class default to yours if omitted.
* `faction` accepts `attacking` / `defending` (resolved to the round's factions) as well as a faction name.
* **Defaults (configurable):** `lineBotCount`, `lineSpacing`, `botDefaultAi`, `botDefaultDeathPolicy`
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc summonLine
  rc summonLine 5
  rc summonLine 8 French ArmyLineInfantry None Replace
  ```

### `summonLineAt`

**Usage:** `rc summonLineAt <playerId> [count] [faction] [class] [ai] [death] [name [regtag [uniformId]]]`

* Same as `summonLine`, but the line is **centred on another player**, facing their direction.
* Faction and class default to **that player's**, not yours.
* Works while you're in free roam or spectating, where the server never learns your own position.
* Everything after the id follows the same grammar as `summonLine`. Replies and errors are sent to you, not to the target.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc summonLineAt 42
  rc summonLineAt 42 10
  rc summonLineAt 42 8 French ArmyLineInfantry None Replace
  ```
* **Bodyguards:** with the `Guardian` AI the whole line escorts the target, so this is the quickest way to put a detail around someone.

  ```
  rc summonLineAt 42 6 Guardian Replace
  ```

### `spawnLine`

**Usage:** `rc spawnLine <x> <z> <rotation> [count] [faction] [class] [ai] [death] [name [regtag [uniformId]]]`

* Spawns a line of bots at world position `(x, z)` facing `rotation` degrees from North.
* `count` overrides `lineBotCount` for this call; faction/class default to caller's if omitted.
* `faction` accepts `attacking` / `defending` (resolved to the round's factions) as well as a faction name.
* **Defaults (configurable):** `lineBotCount`, `lineSpacing`, `botDefaultAi`, `botDefaultDeathPolicy`
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc spawnLine -20 30 90 10 French ArmyLineInfantry
  rc spawnLine 0 50 0
  ```

### `get`

**Usage:** `rc get <Configurable> [additional arguments]`

* Mirrors Holdfast's `rc get` to read **mod configurables** and **mod data** at runtime.
* Additional mod data shortcuts:

  ```
  Player <playerId>
  Players <faction> (Attacking|Defending|Spectator|All) [count]
  Round
  ```
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc get xvxDistance
  rc get Players all
  ```

### `set`

**Usage:** `rc set <Configurable> <Value> [additional arguments]`

* Mirrors Holdfast's `rc set` to set **mod configurables** at runtime.
* **Example:**

  ```
  rc set xvxDistance 5
  rc set lineBotCount 10
  rc set lineSpacing 0.55
  ```

---

## Bot Subcommands

All bot subcommands are accessed via `rc bot <subcommand> [args]`.

### `spawn`

**Usage:** `rc bot spawn [count] [faction class] [ai] [death] [name [regtag [uniformId]]]`

* Spawns one or more specific bots at a random server spawn point.
* `faction` and `class` default to the caller's current faction/class if omitted. Providing `faction` without `class` uses the caller's class.
* `faction` accepts `attacking` / `defending` (resolved to the round's factions) as well as a faction name (e.g. `French`).
* `ai` and `death` default to `botDefaultAi` and `botDefaultDeathPolicy`.
* Arguments are **strictly positional**: omit from the right, not the middle.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot spawn
  rc bot spawn 5
  rc bot spawn Attacking ArmyLineInfantry
  rc bot spawn 3 French ArmyLineInfantry None Replace
  rc bot spawn 1 French ArmyLineInfantry None Replace Soldier 1stBattalion 14
  ```

### `spawnRandom`

**Usage:** `rc bot spawnRandom [count]`

* Spawns one or more bots with a **fully random** faction and class.
* AI and death policy default to `botDefaultAi` and `botDefaultDeathPolicy`.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot spawnRandom
  rc bot spawnRandom 5
  ```

### `summon`

**Usage:** `rc bot summon [faction] [class] [ai] [death] [name [regtag [uniformId]]]`

* Spawns a single bot **at your position**, facing your direction.
* Same faction/class/ai/death defaulting as `spawn`.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot summon
  rc bot summon French ArmyLineInfantry
  rc bot summon Defending ArmyLineInfantry None Replace
  ```

### `summonAt`

**Usage:** `rc bot summonAt <playerId> [faction] [class] [ai] [death] [name [regtag [uniformId]]]`

* Spawns a single bot **at another player's position**, facing their direction.
* Faction and class default to **that player's**, not yours, so dropping a bot on someone needs nothing but their id.
* Works while you're in free roam or spectating, where the server never learns your own position and plain `summon` has nothing to place the bot at.
* Everything after the id follows the same positional grammar as `summon`. Replies and errors are sent to you, not to the target.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot summonAt 42
  rc bot summonAt 42 French ArmyLineInfantry
  rc bot summonAt 42 Defending ArmyLineInfantry Dueling Replace
  ```
* **Bodyguards:** summoning the `Guardian` AI this way makes the target the player it guards, so repeating the command builds an escort around them.

  ```
  rc bot summonAt 42 Guardian Replace
  rc bot summonAt 42 Guardian Replace
  ```

### `setBotAi`

**Usage:** `rc bot setBotAi <target> <ai>`

* Sets the AI behaviour for one or more tracked bots immediately.
* **Target:** `all`, `attacking`, `defending`, `<faction>` (e.g. `French`), or `<playerId>`
* **AI types:** `None`, `Manual`, `StabbingDummy`, `RiposteDummy`, `Dueling`, `Group`, `Guardian`, `Test`: see **[Bot AI Types](#bot-ai-types)**.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot setBotAi all Dueling
  rc bot setBotAi French RiposteDummy
  rc bot setBotAi 42 StabbingDummy
  ```

### `setBotDeathPolicy`

**Usage:** `rc bot setBotDeathPolicy <target> <policy>`

* Sets the death policy for one or more tracked bots.
* **Target:** `all`, `attacking`, `defending`, `<faction>`, or `<playerId>`
* **Policies:**
  * `None`: do nothing, defaulting to in game handling (They respawn at a random spawn as a random class)
  * `Kick`: kick the bot after `botKickDelay` seconds (lets the kill register)
  * `Replace`: kick then re-spawn with the same identity (name, regtag, uniform, faction, class) at death location
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot setBotDeathPolicy all Kick
  rc bot setBotDeathPolicy French Replace
  rc bot setBotDeathPolicy 42 None
  ```

### `remove`

**Usage:** `rc bot remove <target>`

* Kicks (removes) one or more bots from the server immediately.
* **Target:** `all`, `attacking`, `defending`, `<faction>`, or `<playerId>`
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot remove all
  rc bot remove French
  rc bot remove 42
  ```

### `list`

**Usage:** `rc bot list`

* Prints all currently tracked bots to your private messages.
* Shows player ID, faction/class, AI type, death policy, and spawn status.
* **Example:**

  ```
  rc bot list
  ```

### `move`

**Usage:** `rc bot move <target> <behavior> [args]`

* Drives bots that are on the **`Manual`** AI (set it first with `rc bot setBotAi <target> Manual`). Bots on other AIs are left untouched.
* **Target:** `all`, `attacking`, `defending`, `<faction>`, or `<playerId>`
* **Behaviors:**
  * `seek <dest>`: run toward a point/player
  * `arrive <dest>`: like seek, but decelerate to a smooth stop
  * `flee <dest>`: run directly away (`flee me facing me` = backpedal toward you)
  * `pursue <dest>`: lead a moving target to intercept it (predictive seek)
  * `evade <dest>`: flee from where a target is heading (predictive flee)
  * `wander`: roam continuously with gentle random turns
  * `facepoint <dest>`: rotate in place to face a point/player
  * `face <deg>`: rotate in place to a heading (degrees from North)
  * `stop`: halt movement
* **`<dest>`** = `x z` (two numbers), `<playerId>`, or `me`. A player or `me` destination is tracked live as they move.
* **Flags** (any combination, appended anywhere): `separate` (spread apart from other bots), `avoid` (steer around walls), `dodge` (steer around moving agents).
* **`facing <dest>`**: optional; decouples which way the bot faces from the way it travels.
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot setBotAi all Manual
  rc bot move all seek me
  rc bot move all arrive 12 -4 facing me avoid
  rc bot move 42 flee me facing me
  rc bot move all wander separate
  ```

### `cfg`

**Usage:** `rc bot cfg <target> [<lever> <value>]`

* Sets or lists per-bot AI levers, overriding the global default for one bot or group.
* **Target:** `all`, `attacking`, `defending`, `<faction>`, or `<playerId>`
* With `<lever> <value>`: set it on the matching bots. Without: list their current levers.
* Levers held dormant by a switched-off lever are listed after `| inactive:`, tagged with what they wait on,
  e.g. `breakoffRange=6(needs breakoff)`. Setting a dormant lever is allowed and takes effect when its gate opens.
* Only affects bots whose AI is configurable (`StabbingDummy`, `RiposteDummy`, `Dueling*`, `Group*`).
* **Examples:**

  ```
  rc bot cfg 42 stabInterval 2.5
  rc bot cfg all stabDirection High
  rc bot cfg 42
  ```


### `probe` & `act` *(dev tools)*

Diagnostic helpers used while building and validating AI behaviour. They have no effect on normal drills.

* **`rc bot probe <playerId|me|all|attacking|defending|faction> [on|off]`**: logs a player's melee packet actions and hurt events to the server log (to learn the input tokens and timings). Toggles if `on|off` is omitted. Works on any player, human or bot.
  * Also emits a `MeleeSwing` line per tick while that bot's swing is live: `actual` facing, `desired` aim, the `clamped` aim it was given, how much was `held` back, and every squadmate's distance, bearing off the aim and required half-width. `actual` drifting from `clamped` means the bot is not turning as instructed, which is a different problem from the clamp's geometry being wrong.
* **`rc bot act <playerId> <actionToken> [argument]`**: fires a single raw `carbonPlayers` playerAction at a player/bot (e.g. `MeleeBlockHigh`, `MeleeStrikeHigh`, `ExecuteMeleeWeaponStrike`). No AI required.

## Bot AI Types

Assign with `rc bot setBotAi <target> <ai>`, inline when spawning (e.g. `rc bot summon <faction> <class> <ai>`), or via the `botDefaultAi` default.

| AI | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `None` | Does nothing. Stands where it spawned. |
| `Manual` | Manually driven with `rc bot move`, a movement test harness. Issues no orders on its own. |
| `StabbingDummy` | Static training dummy. Stabs on a fixed cadence for block practice. Aim it by facing the way you want when you summon it. |
| `RiposteDummy` | Stands its ground, blocks, and only counters once provoked. Never throws first. |
| `Guardian` | Escorts whoever summoned it. Holds station beside them and fights only what comes within `guardRange`. |
| `Test` | Current development testing settings. |
| `DuelingEasy` / `DuelingNormal` / `Dueling` | Duelling practice. Passive until a player's attack is blocked, then locks onto that attacker and fights to the death. The tiers differ only in reaction speed. Several attacked by one player form up so they stop crowding each other. |
| `GroupEasy` / `GroupNormal` / `Group` / `GroupHard` | Drill station for 1vXs. Provoking any one wakes all of them; they give ground, re-form, fight as a line, and return to post. See **[Group drill stations](#group-drill-stations)**. `GroupHard` is `Group` with spaced updowns, so they can be blocked one at a time. |

`RiposteDummy` and the `Dueling` and `Group` tiers are presets of one configurable melee AI: the same behaviour with different capability toggles (`press`, `riposte`, `move`, `pursue`, `engageOnAttack`, `squad`, `post`) and tuning. `StabbingDummy` is a separate static-stabber AI. You can tweak any of them per bot with `rc bot cfg`.

### Group drill stations

A `Group` bot is for practising 2v1s and 3v1s on your own. Summon a batch and leave it:

```
rc summonLine 2 Defending ArmyLineInfantry Group Replace
```

**Batch vs formation.** Bots from one `summonLine`, `spawnLine` or `rc bot summon <count>` are a **batch**: shared
post, they wake together, and a `Replace` bot rejoins it. Any engaged batches on the **same player** merge into
one **formation**, then split back to their own posts. So walking separately summoned bots onto one player builds
a group that plays exactly like a summoned one.

**The cycle:**

| Phase | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Waiting | Hold post, block, never attack. Bystanders can walk past. |
| Provoked | Attack any one and the whole group wakes onto whoever did it. A killing blow counts too. |
| Backing off | Give up to `breakoffRange` metres of ground and re-form. Skipped when `breakoff` is off. |
| Standing | For `engageDelay` seconds from the provocation they block but will not swing or counter. |
| Fighting | The line holds a point and rotates around it, shares guard, and throws opposite stabs. |
| Re-arming | Die or leave `resetRange` and they return to post and go quiet. |

`minMembers` with `holdReplacement` makes the group run shorthanded until it is no longer the drill, then reset.
Without them a killed member is replaced mid-bout, which makes an endurance grind instead.

A group that disengages while you are alive still blocks and counters the whole way home, and only goes quiet
once re-formed, you die or leave, or ten seconds pass. Waiting, backing off, standing and withdrawing all use
`passiveBlockReaction` rather than the tier's reaction beat.

**Stations without a group.** `post` is independent of `squad`, so a single bot of any melee preset can hold one:

```
rc bot summon Defending ArmyLineInfantry Dueling Replace
rc bot cfg <id> post true
rc bot cfg <id> breakoff true
```

That is a 1v1 sparring partner that waits on its mark, resets distance when attacked, and walks back afterwards.

### Configurable AI levers

Some AIs expose named **levers** you can tune. A lever starts at its built-in default, is overridden by the global default if one is set, and is overridden again by a per-bot value.

* **Per-bot override**: `rc bot cfg <target> <lever> <value>` (that bot/group only). List with `rc bot cfg <target>`.
* **Global default**: `rc set globalAI <AiType> <lever> <value>`. New bots of that AI start from it. Read with `rc get globalAI <AiType> <lever>`, and persist it in a rotation config with the `SetGlobalAi` config variable.

Changing a global default affects **newly created** bots of that AI, not ones already spawned.

**`StabbingDummy` levers**

| Lever | Values | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stabInterval` | float > 0 (seconds) | `1.7` | Delay between stabs. |
| `stabDirection` | `Random` / `High` / `Low` / `Alternate` | `Random` | Which way each stab is thrown. |

*Example: a slow, high-only dummy.*

```
rc bot summon Defending ArmyLineInfantry
rc bot setBotAi <id> StabbingDummy
rc bot cfg <id> stabInterval 3
rc bot cfg <id> stabDirection High
```

**`RiposteDummy` / `Dueling*` levers**

`RiposteDummy` and the `Dueling` and `Group` difficulty tiers are presets of one melee AI and share the same levers. Within each family the tiers are identical except for their reaction speeds, and the `Group` tiers are the `Dueling` tiers plus `squad` and `post`. Booleans are `true`/`false` (`on`/`off` still accepted as input).

**Toggles & targeting** (the `Dueling` and `Group` tiers share one column):

| Setting | `RiposteDummy` | `Dueling*` / `Group*` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `press` | `false` | `true` | Throw the first blow when the enemy isn't threatening. |
| `riposte` | `true` | `true` | Counter after the guard absorbs a hit. |
| `move` | `false` | `true` | Hold/adjust melee spacing vs. stand its ground. |
| `pursue` | `false` | `true` | Advance toward a target that is too far. `false` lets a player back away and disengage. |
| `stickyTarget` | `false` | `false` | Keep one target while valid, versus re-picking the closest each tick. |
| `targetRange` | `3` | `3` | Only engage players within this many metres, `0` = unlimited. For the `Dueling` tiers this is also the passive read range. |
| `engageOnAttack` | `false` | `true` | Start passive and engage only a player whose attack it blocks, fighting that target until it dies. |

**Difficulty** comes in two halves: reaction beats (how fast a bot answers you) and formation levers `coordinate`, `slotError` and `formationLag` (how well it holds its place beside another bot). The second half matters more in a group. Reactions alone give you a slow pair that still stands in a perfect line and throws perfectly opposite stabs.

Every formation lever is **the worst a bot may be, not how bad it is**. Each roll runs from zero up to the lever, so a bot can come out correct by chance and a lower tier does so less often. A pair that is *usually* too wide has to be read every bout instead of solved once. `squadSpacing` stays at `0.9` for every tier. Only the stray from it changes.

**Reaction beats**: the levers that separate the tiers (`seconds ≥ 0`).

The `Dueling` and `Group` families have separate ladders.

*Dueling family, plus the two standalone presets:*

| Lever | `Guardian` | `RiposteDummy` | `DuelingEasy` | `DuelingNormal` | `Dueling` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `blockReactionMin` | `0.5` | `0.1` | `0.3` | `0.1` | `0` | Min delay between reading an attack and raising the guard. The main difficulty knob. |
| `blockReactionMax` | `0.8` | `0.2` | `0.5` | `0.2` | `0` | Max of that delay; each block rolls between min and max. |
| `riposteReactionMin` | `0.4` | `0` | `0.2` | `0` | `0` | Min delay between a block landing and the counter. |
| `riposteReactionMax` | `1.1` | `0.5` | `0.8` | `0.5` | `0` | Max of that delay. |
| `attackReadBeat` | `1.2` | `0.6` | `0.9` | `0.6` | `0.3` | Extra randomised beat on the attack cooldown. Lower presses faster. |

*Group family:*

| Lever | `GroupEasy` | `GroupNormal` | `GroupHard` | `Group` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `blockReactionMin` / `Max` | `0.1` / `0.2` | `0.1` / `0.2` | `0` / `0` | `0` / `0` |
| `riposteReactionMin` / `Max` | `0` / `0.5` | `0` / `0.5` | `0` / `0.1` | `0` / `0` |
| `attackReadBeat` | `0.1` | `0.3` | `0.3` | `0.3` |
| `slotError` | `0.5` | `0.5` | `0.1` | `0` |
| `formationLag` | `0.2` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `coordinate` | `0.97` | `0.98` | `1` | `1` |
| `stabSeparation` | `0.3` | `0.25` | `0.15` | `0` |
| `squadSpacingVariance` | `0.5` | `0.3` | `0.1` | `0` |

**Shared tuning**: the rest of the lever set, grouped by what it does. Same defaults across all these
presets unless the Default column says otherwise (`seconds >= 0` or `metres`, floats).

**Ranges and timing**

| Lever | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offensiveRange` | `0.7` | Close spacing it presses to (metres). |
| `offensiveRangeVariance` | `0.1` | Random jitter added on top of `offensiveRange`. |
| `defensiveRange` | `2.0` | Reading spacing it guards from (metres). |
| `defensiveRangeVariance` | `0.4` | Random jitter added on top of `defensiveRange`. |
| `attackRange` | `2.0` | How close a press attack commits a stab. A riposte ignores this. |
| `riposteWindow` | `0.6` | How long the post-block counter stays available (seconds). |
| `passiveRange` | `0.6` | `Dueling` tiers: hold distance while waiting. Uses `defensiveRange` once engaged. |
| `passiveBlockReaction` | `0` | Block reaction beat while waiting to be provoked, instead of `blockReactionMin`/`Max`. Not randomised. |

**Targeting**

The rest of the targeting set (`targetRange`, `stickyTarget`, `engageOnAttack`) varies by preset and is in the toggles table above. These two do not:

| Lever | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ignoreTeam` | `true` | Target any player regardless of faction. `false` = enemies only. |
| `ignoreBots` | `true` | Target only human players, skipping bots. Defaults to `true` so bots focus the player and don't provoke each other. |

**Guard**

| Lever | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `guard` | `false` (`true` for `Guardian`) | Act as an escort for `guardTarget`. |
| `guardTarget` | `0` | The player id this bot escorts, `0` for none. Set automatically by the summon commands. |
| `guardRange` | `10` | An enemy this close to the guarded player pulls the bot into the fight. |
| `guardFollowRange` | `3` | `Guardian`: how far from the guarded player the bot holds station while nothing is happening. |
| `separationRange` | `0.8` for `Dueling*` / `Group*` / `Test`, `1.5` for `Guardian`, `0` otherwise | Push apart from other bots within this many metres. `0` disables. |

**Formation**

| Lever | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `squad` | `true` for `Dueling*` / `Group*` / `Test`, `false` otherwise | Stand in a formation with the rest of the spawn batch, and with any other engaged batch on the same player. Spacing and lane discipline only. |
| `coordinate` | `0`–`1`. `0.5` neutral, and the `Dueling*` default. `Group*`: `0.97` Easy, `0.98` Normal, `1` top | The updown axis, decided per swing. `1` always throws opposite to the neighbour, `0` always the same, `0.5` a free pick. Above `0.5` also shares the guard. Needs `squad`. |
| `slotError` | `0.9` DuelingEasy, `0.5` DuelingNormal / GroupEasy / GroupNormal, `0.1` GroupHard, `0` Dueling and Group | The furthest a bot may stand from its place on the ring, in metres. Re-rolled every few seconds. Needs `squad`. |
| `formationLag` | `1.2` DuelingEasy, `0.6` DuelingNormal, `0.2` GroupEasy, `0` GroupNormal and top tiers | The longest a bot may work from a stale slot, in seconds. `0` tracks perfectly. Needs `squad`. |
| `stabSeparation` | `0.35` GroupEasy, `0.25` GroupNormal, `0.15` GroupHard, `0` elsewhere | Smallest gap between two opposite stabs from one formation. `0` leaves them unblockable. Needs `squad`. |
| `aimPitch` | `0` | Vertical aim in the engine's pitch scale, `0` level and negative down. Blade geometry follows it automatically. |
| `squadSpacing` | `0.85` | The tightest the line ever stands, and the floor its breathing works up from. |
| `squadSpacingVariance` | `0.7`; `Group*`: `0.5` Easy, `0.3` Normal, `0.1` Hard, `0` Group | How much wider than `squadSpacing` the line may drift mid-fight. Only while engaged; a posted line settles back to the floor. `0` = a fixed gap. Needs `squad`. |
| `laneHalfWidth` | `0.5` | How close a squadmate may be to the swing line before the shot counts as blocked. Keep it under `squadSpacing`. |
| `squadStandoff` | `1.5` | Range the formation's point holds from the enemy. `1.5` is the practical ceiling. |

**Mate avoidance**

How a bot keeps its own bayonet off the squadmate beside it.

| Lever | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gateRadius` | `0.3` | Half-width used to refuse a stab outright. The only mate-avoidance lever that costs aggression. |
| `clampRadius` | `0.4` | Half-width used to stop the bot turning mid-stab. Costs tracking only, never cancels a swing. |
| `bladeMargin` | `5` | Degrees of slack kept outside a mate's band rather than stopping on its boundary. |
| `mateCrowdRatio` | `1` | A mate closer than this many formation spacings blocks the stab at any bearing ahead. Clamp only, `0` disables. |
| `mateConeFloor` | `28` | The narrowest the danger cone around a squadmate may get, in degrees. Clamp only, never the release gate. |
| `gateOnMate` | `true` | Hold fire while a mate stands in the blade's band, instead of stabbing and hoping. |
| `abortOnMate` | `false` | Block to cancel the bot's own stab when a mate is already across the blade. Unreliable. |

**Stations**

| Lever | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `post` | `true` for `Dueling*` / `Group*` / `Test`, `false` otherwise | Make it a drill station: wait on the mark, and walk back afterwards. Independent of `squad`. |
| `breakoff` | `false` (`true` for `Group*`) | Once provoked, give ground and re-form before throwing anything. Needs `post`. |
| `breakoffRange` | `2` | Ground given once, in metres, measured from where the group was provoked rather than held from the player. Needs `breakoff`. |
| `engageDelay` | `0` (`1.5` for `Group*`) | Seconds from the first provocation before the group may swing or counter. It blocks throughout. Needs `post`. |
| `resetRange` | `0` | How far the target may get from the post before the group gives up. `0` = no limit. |
| `minMembers` | `0` (`2` for `Group*`) | Fewest members the batch will fight with; below it the bout ends and the group withdraws. Capped by the batch's own size. Needs `post`. |
| `holdReplacement` | `false` (`true` for `Group*`) | A dead member's replacement waits for the bout to finish. Only for a member killed by the group's own opponent. Needs `post`. |
| `returnDelay` | `30` | Seconds the group holds where the bout ended before walking back to the post. |

## Mod Config Variables

Use **global** `mod_variable` or **per‑map** `mod_variable_local` to set MDS options in rotation configs.

**Format:** `MDS:<ConfigVariable>:<Argument(s)>`

### General

* **EnableDebugLogging**: `true | false`
* **EnableAdminOnly**: `true | false`

### Arena

* **SetArena**: `(x,z),(x,z)`
* **AddArena**: `(x,z),(x,z)`
* **SetArenaCorner1**: `x,z`
* **SetArenaCorner2**: `x,z`

### Drill

* **SetXvXDistance**: `distance(float)`
* **SetXvXSpacing**: `distance(float)`
* **SetXvXStrategy**: `Random | Next | Any | Repeat`
* **SetGroupfightDistance**: `distance(float)`
* **SetGroupfightSpacing**: `distance(float)`
* **SetGroupfightStrategy**: `Random | Repeat`
* **SetOpenMeleeSpacing**: `distance(float)`
* **SetOpenMeleeOffset**: `distance(float)`
* **SetOrientation**: `degree(int)` **or** `NorthSouth | EastWest | SouthNorth | WestEast | Random`

### Bot

* **SetBotDefaultAi**: `None | Manual | StabbingDummy | RiposteDummy | DuelingEasy | DuelingNormal | Dueling | GroupEasy | GroupNormal | Group | Guardian | Test`
* **SetBotDefaultDeathPolicy**: `None | Kick | Replace`
* **SetBotKickDelay**: `seconds(float)`
* **SetBotReplaceDelay**: `seconds(float)`
* **SetGlobalAi**: `<AiType>,<lever>,<value>`

  Sets a global default for one configurable AI lever at map load, the persistent form of `rc set globalAI`. Repeat it for each lever. Per-bot `rc bot cfg` still overrides. Spaces also work in place of commas.

  *Examples:*

  ```
  mod_variable_local MDS:SetGlobalAi:StabbingDummy,stabInterval,2.5
  mod_variable_local MDS:SetGlobalAi:StabbingDummy,stabDirection,High
  ```
* **SpawnBot**: `x,z,rotation[,faction][,class][,ai][,death][,name[,regtag[,uniformId]]]`

  Schedules a single bot to spawn at a world position when the round begins. Specify it multiple times for multiple bots. Same fields as `SpawnLine` but with no `count`; use `SpawnLine` when you want more than one bot.
  * `x,z,rotation`: required. World position and facing (degrees from North).
  * `faction`: optional. `attacking` (default), `defending`, or a faction name (e.g. `French`). `attacking`/`defending` resolve against the live round at spawn time, so the same config works across maps.
  * `class`: optional. Defaults to `ArmyLineInfantry`.
  * `ai,death`: optional. Default to `botDefaultAi` / `botDefaultDeathPolicy`.
  * `name,regtag,uniformId`: optional identity extras.

  *Examples:*

  ```
  mod_variable_local MDS:SpawnBot:-20,30,90
  mod_variable_local MDS:SpawnBot:12,-4,180,defending,ArmyLineInfantry,Dueling,Replace
  ```

### Line

* **SetLineBotCount**: `count(int)`
* **SetLineSpacing**: `metres(float)`
* **SpawnLine**: `x,z,rotation[,count][,faction][,class][,ai][,death][,name[,regtag[,uniformId]]]`

  Schedules a shoulder‑to‑shoulder bot line to spawn when the round begins. Specify it multiple times for multiple lines (e.g. two opposing lines). Mirrors the `rc spawnLine` grammar, with map‑load defaults instead of a caller:
  * `x,z,rotation`: required. World position and facing (degrees from North).
  * `count`: optional. Defaults to `lineBotCount`.
  * `faction`: optional. `attacking` (default), `defending`, or a faction name (e.g. `French`). `attacking`/`defending` resolve against the live round at spawn time, so the same config works across maps.
  * `class`: optional. Defaults to `ArmyLineInfantry`.
  * `ai,death`: optional. Default to `botDefaultAi` / `botDefaultDeathPolicy`.
  * `name,regtag,uniformId`: optional identity extras.

  *Examples:*

  ```
  mod_variable_local MDS:SpawnLine:-20,30,90
  mod_variable_local MDS:SpawnLine:-20,30,90,French
  mod_variable_local MDS:SpawnLine:20,30,270,10,defending,ArmyLineInfantry,None,Replace,Bot,None,1
  ```
